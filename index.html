  <h1>More About Me</h1>
  <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
  <p>I have too many hobbies to list, but my primary interests are playing and recording music, weight training, motorcycling, learning new skills and construction projects (from building structures to small woodworking projects).</p>
  <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
  <p>My dream job allows me to be <strong>creative and make an impact</strong>. It also allows schedule flexibility and autonomy. I love creating &amp; building things. My tech background and inclination to learning new skills makes <strong>Web Development</strong> a good fit for me in many ways.</p>
  <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
  <p>Music has played a very important role in my life since I was a child. I like all kinds of styles, but tend to gravitate to the blues, rock &amp; roll, soul and R&amp;B music. I often get into a couple of albums and overdose on them for a period. Lately I have
    been listening to a lot of
