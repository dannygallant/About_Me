Describe yourself in two to three sentences.

I live in Austin, TX. My wife & I are pet collectors. We have 4 dogs & 3 cats, all rescues.
I'm Canadian and I've had several job roles since my first position as a bicycle builder at a Canadian Tire store when I was 14 years old.

What's important to you?

Honesty, integrity and a job well done.

Where are you from?

I was born in Montreal. My family moved often when my brothers & I were young. We left Montreal when I was 6 or 7 years old and moved to the province of New Brunswick. We lived in several towns in N.B. I graduated from the Universite de Moncton with a bachelor's degree in business administration and an MIS major. I have lived in Austin, TX since 1999.

What are your favorite hobbies?

I have too many hobbies to list, but my primary interests are playing & recording music, weight training, motorcycling, learning new skills and construction projects (from building structures to small woodworking projects).

What's your dream job?

My dream job allows me to be creative and make an impact. It also allows schedule flexibility and autonomy. I love creating & building things. My tech background and inclination to learning new skills makes front end web development a good fit for me in many ways.

What music have you been listening to lately?

Music has played a very important role in my life since I was a child. I like all kinds of  styles, but tend to gravitate to the blues, rock & roll, soul and R&B music. I often get into a couple of albums and overdose on them for a period, before moving onto other discoveries. Lately I have been listening to a lot of Vintage Trouble, Charles Bradley, Blackberry Smoke and Rival Sons.
